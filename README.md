This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


The goal of this project is to build a simple interface that a coffee shop could use to create
and view drink recipes.

A drink recipe combines actions and ingredients in an ordered list.

## Installing a Dependency

The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:

```
npm install --save
```


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


Start your app by running `npm start`, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing `F5` or by clicking the green debug icon. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified codeâ€”all from your editor.
